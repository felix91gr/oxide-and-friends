## Appendix: Cool Technical Blogs

Crowdsourced by folks.

- [Nova](https://trynova.dev/blog/) - in the writer's words, _"a JavaScript apologist's exploration of how JavaScript could be good"_
- [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/) - **TODO: description**
- [Hillel Wayne](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/) - tons of formal methods talk. Also about quality assurance in the world of software, in general.
- [Reid Atcheson](https://www.reidatcheson.com) - down the rabbit hole of computational math; this person is a floating point savant.
- [Computational Complexity Blog](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org) - what it says on the tin. It might be the best blog-like resource on computational complexity.
