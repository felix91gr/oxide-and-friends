## Technical Blogging

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording]().

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
speakers included
[Tim Bray](https://cosocial.ca/@timbray) ([BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/tbray.org.)),
[Will Snow](), **TODO: find Snow's link**
[Cynthia Dunlop](https://bsky.app/profile/cynthiadunlop.bsky.social)
and
[Piotr Sarna](https://bsky.app/profile/sarna.dev).
(Did we miss your name and/or get it wrong? Drop a PR!)

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Topic](link)
- [@M:SS](link into recording)
  *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- PRs needed!

## Appendix: Cool Technical Blogs

Crowdsourced by folks.

- [Nova](https://trynova.dev/blog/) - in the writer's words, _"a JavaScript apologist's exploration of how JavaScript could be good"_
- [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/) - **TODO: description**
- [Hillel Wayne](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/) - tons of formal methods talk. Also about quality assurance in the world of software, in general.
- [Reid Atcheson](https://www.reidatcheson.com) - down the rabbit hole of computational math; this person is a floating point savant.
- [Computational Complexity Blog](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org) - what it says on the tin. It might be the best blog-like resource on computational complexity.

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
server; stay tuned to our Mastodon feeds for details, or [subscribe to this
